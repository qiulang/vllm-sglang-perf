## Why AWQ fails for GLM-4

The architectural difference between traditional `gate_proj` and GLM-4's `gate_up_proj`, which is at the heart of your AWQ compatibility issue.

### Traditional LLaMA-style MLP Architecture

In standard transformer models like LLaMA, the MLP (feedforward) layers have **three separate linear projections**:

```
Input (hidden_size) 
    ↓
┌─── gate_proj ───┐    ┌─── up_proj ───┐
│   (4096 → 11008) │    │ (4096 → 11008) │
└─────────────────┘    └───────────────┘
         ↓                       ↓
    SiLU/SwiGLU                Identity
         ↓                       ↓
         └──── Element-wise ──────┘
                Multiply
                   ↓
              down_proj
            (11008 → 4096)
                   ↓
               Output
```

**Code representation:**

```python
# LLaMA-style MLP
class LlamaMLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.gate_proj = nn.Linear(4096, 11008, bias=False)  # Gating projection
        self.up_proj = nn.Linear(4096, 11008, bias=False)    # Up projection  
        self.down_proj = nn.Linear(11008, 4096, bias=False)  # Down projection
        
    def forward(self, x):
        gate = F.silu(self.gate_proj(x))  # Apply activation
        up = self.up_proj(x)              # No activation
        return self.down_proj(gate * up)  # Element-wise multiply then down
```

### GLM-4's Combined `gate_up_proj` Architecture

GLM-4 **combines** the gate and up projections into a **single fused linear layer** for efficiency:

```
Input (hidden_size: 4096)
    ↓
gate_up_proj (4096 → 27392)  # Note: 27392 = 2 × 13696
    ↓
Split into two halves
    ↓
┌─── Gate (13696) ───┐    ┌─── Up (13696) ───┐
│      SiLU/SwiGLU   │    │     Identity     │
└────────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘
         ↓                         ↓
         └──── Element-wise ────────┘
                Multiply
                   ↓
              down_proj
            (13696 → 4096)
                   ↓
               Output
```

**Code representation:**

```python
# GLM-4 MLP
class Glm4MLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        # Single fused projection: 4096 → 27392 (2 × 13696)
        self.gate_up_proj = nn.Linear(4096, 27392, bias=False)
        self.down_proj = nn.Linear(13696, 4096, bias=False)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        gate_up = self.gate_up_proj(x)  # Single projection
        
        # Split the output into gate and up components
        gate, up = gate_up.chunk(2, dim=-1)  # Split 27392 → 13696 + 13696
        
        gate = F.silu(gate)  # Apply activation to gate part
        return self.down_proj(gate * up)  # Multiply and down project
```

### Key Differences

| Aspect                | LLaMA-style                                 | GLM-4                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Number of layers**  | 3 separate (gate_proj, up_proj, down_proj)  | 2 layers (gate_up_proj, down_proj)            |
| **Memory efficiency** | Less efficient (2 separate weight matrices) | More efficient (1 fused weight matrix)        |
| **Computation**       | 2 separate matrix multiplications           | 1 matrix multiplication + split               |
| **Parameter names**   | `gate_proj`, `up_proj`                      | `gate_up_proj`                                |
| **Intermediate size** | 2 × intermediate_size parameters            | 2 × intermediate_size parameters (same total) |

### Why This Breaks AWQ

AWQ's algorithm specifically looks for separate `gate_proj` and `up_proj` layers because:

1. **Activation-aware scaling**: AWQ analyzes activation patterns to determine which weights are "salient"
2. **Per-layer optimization**: It applies different scaling factors to gate vs up projections
3. **Hardcoded layer matching**: The code literally searches for layers named `gate_proj`

When AWQ encounters GLM-4's `gate_up_proj`, it fails because:

- It can't find the expected `gate_proj` layer name
- It doesn't know how to handle the fused projection
- The activation analysis logic assumes separate gate/up computations

### Performance Implications

GLM-4's approach is actually **more efficient**:

- **Memory**: Single weight matrix vs two separate matrices
- **Computation**: One GEMM operation vs two GEMM operations
- **Cache efficiency**: Better memory access patterns

This is why GLM-4 chose this architecture - it's a smart optimization that unfortunately breaks compatibility with tools designed around the older LLaMA pattern.

###  Solution Context

This is why GPTQ works better for GLM-4 - it's more flexible about layer patterns and doesn't make assumptions about specific MLP architectures. GPTQ analyzes the computational graph more generally rather than expecting specific layer naming conventions.

# AWQ vs GPTQ

Here's a comprehensive comparison between GPTQ and AWQ quantization methods:

## Core Methodology

**GPTQ (Generative Pre-trained Transformer Quantization)**

- Uses second-order information (Hessian matrix) to minimize quantization error
- Applies layer-by-layer sequential quantization using the inverse Hessian
- Focuses on finding optimal quantization parameters through mathematical optimization
- More computationally intensive during quantization process

**AWQ (Activation-Aware Weight Quantization)**

- Identifies salient weights based on activation distribution, protecting only 1% of important weights from quantization
- Uses equivalent transformation to scale salient weight channels rather than mixed-precision quantization
- Does not rely on backpropagation or reconstruction, making it more generalizable
- Faster quantization process with simpler implementation

## Performance Comparison

**Speed & Efficiency**

- AWQ claims significant speed-up compared to GPTQ while maintaining similar or better performance
- AWQ offers more than 3x speedup over Hugging Face FP16 implementation on both desktop and mobile GPUs
- GPTQ typically requires more time during the quantization process due to Hessian calculations

**Accuracy Retention**

- AWQ achieves excellent quantization performance for instruction-tuned models and multi-modal models
- GPTQ has proven track record with INT4 models reaching 99% of FP32 accuracy for Llama 2 models
- Both methods generally maintain high accuracy, but effectiveness varies by model architecture

## Hardware & Deployment

**Hardware Support**

- **GPTQ**: Broader hardware support, works well on various GPU architectures
- **AWQ**: Hardware-friendly approach specifically designed for edge devices, with optimized support for NVIDIA GPUs

- **AWQ**: Pre-computed model zoo focuses mainly on LLaMA, OPT, CodeLlama, StarCoder, Vicuna models
- **GLM-4 Specific**: GPTQ has better architecture flexibility, while AWQ is hardcoded for LLaMA-style architectures

## Ecosystem Integration

**Framework Support**

## Summary Table

| Aspect                   | GPTQ                         | AWQ                       |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Quantization Speed**   | Slower (Hessian computation) | Faster (no backprop)      |
